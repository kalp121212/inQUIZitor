A simulation of the famous game show KBC(Kaun Banega Crorepati) using Java.
I have added the original sound effects and the colours to make a good looking GUI just like the one from the actual show. About 70-80 questions have been added on different topics and each topic corresponds to a different reward. Lifelines have also been implemented like the actual KBC game

To run the code, open the project in a Java IDE like Eclipse and you can directly run the code from there
